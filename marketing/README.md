## Quick Summary

**Strategy:** Sell on Tindie first, market through Reddit/HN/YouTube. No Kickstarter, no marketing agency, no paid ads. Start scrappy, iterate based on real sales.

**Pricing:** $42 assembled, $22 kit (no Pico included).

**Launch order:** r/raspberry_pi (soft launch) > r/pcgaming + r/htpc (broad) > Hacker News > YouTube reviewers.

## Assets Needed Before Launch

- [ ] Product photos (5-8 shots, see shot list in `tindie-listing.md`)
- [ ] 30-second demo video (phone + tripod)
- [ ] GIF for README and listings (5-10 seconds)
- [ ] Simple logo (SVG + PNG)
- [ ] Hardware files committed to repo (PCB in `pcb/`, enclosure in `case/`)
- [ ] User docs written (`docs/setup.md`, `docs/pairing.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`)
