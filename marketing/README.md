Plans and draft copy for getting PadProxy into the hands of people who want it.

## The Short Version

Couch gaming on PC is broken -- there's no way to wake your PC from a wireless controller the way consoles do. PadProxy fixes that, and nothing else like it exists. The goal isn't to make money; it's to make this thing available to the people who've been wanting it. Tindie sales cover component costs so the project sustains itself. The design files are always free on GitHub.
